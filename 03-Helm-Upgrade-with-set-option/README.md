# Helm Upgrade with set option

## Step-01: Introduction
- We are going to upgrade the HELM RELEASE using `helm upgrade` command in combination with `--set "image.tag=<DOCKER-IMAGE-TAGS>`
- We will use the following Helm Commands in this demo.
- helm repo 
- helm search repo
- helm install
- helm upgrade
- helm history
- helm status

## Step-02: Custom Helm Repo
### Step-02-01: Review our Custom Helm Repo
- [artifacthub.io](https://artifacthub.io): Search for `stacksimplify`

### Step-02-02: Add Custom Helm Repo
```t
# List Helm Repositories
helm repo list

# Add Helm Repository
helm repo add <DESIRED-NAME> <HELM-REPO-URL>
helm repo add stacksimplify https://stacksimplify.github.io/helm-charts/

# List Helm Repositories
helm repo list

# Search Helm Repository
helm search repo <KEY-WORD>
helm search repo mychart2
```

## Step-03: Install Helm Chart from our Custom Helm Repository
```t
# Install myapp1 Helm Chart
helm install <RELEASE-NAME> <repo_name_in_your_local_desktop/chart_name>
helm install myapp1 stacksimplify/mychart1 
```
## Step-04: List Resources and Access Application in Browser
```t
# List Helm Release
helm ls 
or 
helm list

# List Pods
kubectl get pods

# List Services 
kubectl get svc

#Forward Port
kubectl port-forward svc/myapp1-mychart2 31232:80


# Access Application If you are using Docker Desktop
http://localhost:<NODE-PORT>
http://localhost:31231
```

## Step-04: Helm Upgrade
- [kubenginx Docker Image with 1.0.0, 2.0.0, 3.0.0, 4.0.0](https://github.com/users/stacksimplify/packages/container/package/kubenginx)
```t
# Review the Docker Image Versions we are using
https://github.com/users/stacksimplify/packages/container/package/kubenginx
Image Tags: 1.0.0, 2.0.0, 3.0.0, 4.0.0

# Helm Upgrade
helm upgrade <RELEASE-NAME> <repo_name_in_your_local_desktop/chart_name> --set <OVERRIDE-VALUE-FROM-values.yaml>
helm upgrade myapp1 stacksimplify/mychart2 --set "image.tag=2.0.0"
```
## Step-05: List Resources after helm upgrade
```t
# List Helm Releases
helm list 
Observation: We should see Revision as 2

# Additional List commands
helm list --superseded
helm list --deployed

# List and Describe Pod
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod <POD-NAME> 
Observation: In the Pod Events you should find that "ghcr.io/stacksimplify/kubenginx:2.0.0" is pulled or if already exists on desktop it will be used to create this new pod

# Get the Service
kubectl get svc


#Port forward
kubectl port-forward svc/myapp1-mychart2 31232:80


# Access Application
http://localhost:<NODE-PORT>
http://localhost:31232
Observation: Version 2 of application should be displayed
```

## Step-06: Do two more helm upgrades - For practice purpose
```t
# Helm Upgrade to 3.0.0
helm upgrade myapp1 stacksimplify/mychart2 --set="image.tag=3.0.0"

# Access Application
http://localhost:<NODE-PORT>
http://localhost:31232

# Helm Upgrade to 4.0.0
helm upgrade myapp1 stacksimplify/mychart2 --set="image.tag=4.0.0"

# Access Application
http://localhost:<NODE-PORT>
http://localhost:31232
```

## Step-07: Helm History
- History prints historical revisions for a given release.
```t
# helm history
helm history RELEASE_NAME
helm history myapp1
```

## Step-08: Helm Status
- This command shows the status of a named release. 
```t
# Helm Status
helm status RELEASE_NAME
helm status myapp1

# Helm Status - revision (display the status of the named release with revision)
helm status RELEASE_NAME --revision int
helm status myapp1 --revision 2
```

## Step-09: Uninstall Helm Release
```t
# Uninstall Helm Release
helm uninstall myapp1
```
